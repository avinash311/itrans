  <h4>Spreadsheet customization for the online itrans page</h4>

  The online itrans page uses a spreadsheet for converting input text to Unicode characters.
  Users can make a copy of the spreadsheet, modify it, and upload it to the online itrans
  page, to have the conversion use the modified mappings.

      <h4>Using your own character mapping</h4>
      This is a customizable application. The goal is to allow users to provide their own
      input to output mapping, by using their own version of the spreadsheet shown above. While
      itrans is used for Indic script output, the spreadsheet can be used to for any Unicode
      conversion of input text, based on one-to-one mapping of each input code to any string
      of Unicode characters.
      <p>
      There is no support available for this tool, other than this document. Knowledge
      of web tools and editors is required to modify the default behavior.
      In addition to the steps below,
      the code can also be copied by looking at the source of this web page, and a local
      web page created with input and output text boxes as desired.
      <p>
      <ol>
      <li>First, make a copy of the default spreadsheet. Either make an online copy,
      or download the spreadsheet if you wish to edit it using Excel or LibreOffice or other
      desktop application.</li>
      <li>To make a copy: Use the <code>File &rarr; Make a copy ... </code> command.</li>
      <li>Or, download a copy: Use the <code>File &rarr; Download As... </code> command.</li>
      <li>Then, edit your copy of the spreadsheet. The most common changes are to edit the
      rows in the <code>INPUT</code> column so that it uses different input codes.</li>
      <li>
      The 
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14wZl8zCa4khZV3El2VGoqurKBLGx21mbS-yORi4w7Qo/edit?usp=sharing">default spreadsheet for itrans conversion</a> has many cells with notes
      that describe the rows and columns in more detail.
      In short: make sure each row of the <code>INPUT</code> has unique codes with no
      duplicates. If creating new rows, copy and existing row to make sure it has data
      in all the columns.</li>
      <li>Once you have the spreadsheet data as you need it, export or download the spreadsheet
      as a tab-separated file. Only tab-separated .tsv files can then be loaded on this web
      page.</li>
      <li>Every spreadsheet program has a way to save a spreadsheet in a Tab-Separated format.
      In the online Google Spreadsheets for example, use the <code>File &rarr; Download As... </code> command with the <code>Tab-separated values (.tsv, current sheet)</code>.
      Destktop spreadsheet programs may have different ways to do this - for example, the
      <code>Save As</code> may offer a way to save it in a Tab-Separated format and use a
      <code>.txt</code>
      file extension.. Or there may be an <code>Export</code> command that offers that.</li>
      <li>The tab-separated text spreadsheet can be loaded using the <em>Load tab-separated spreadsheet with itrans data</em> input field on the <a href="index.html">Online Itrans</a>
      page.</li>
      <li>If the spreadsheet has no errors, it will be loaded and a message printed in the section above. If there are errors, it will pop up a dialog box with the error message.</li>
      <li>For easier use, there is the <b>tsv=</b> URL parameter for the <a href="index.html">Online Itrans</a> URL,
        to load any custom table on page startup. This avoids the need to click on the <em>Load tab-separated spreadsheet with itrans data</em> button.
        Make sure to provide the URL of a tab-separated text file. For example, the default table from the Google Docs spreadsheet can also be loaded by using this URL:
        <br>
        <b>https://www.aczoom.com/itrans/online/?s=hindi&#x26;tsv=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14wZl8zCa4khZV3El2VGoqurKBLGx21mbS-yORi4w7Qo/export?format%3Dtsv%26gid%3D0</b>
        <br>
        The tsv= string should be URL encoded. At a minimum, encode = (%3D) and &amp; (%26) in the tsv= value, as shown. The Google Docs Spreadsheet used for the
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14wZl8zCa4khZV3El2VGoqurKBLGx21mbS-yORi4w7Qo/edit?usp=sharing">default spreadsheet for itrans conversion</a>
        can be downloaded as a TSV text file using the URL
        <b>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14wZl8zCa4khZV3El2VGoqurKBLGx21mbS-yORi4w7Qo/export?format=tsv&amp;gid=0</b>
        <br>
        and that URL string should be provided as a parameter to tsv=, after encoding it as a string by replacing the = and &amp; characters as shown above.
        <br>
        There is no requirement to use Google Docs. Any URL that shows a tab-seprated text file with the itrans conversion tables can be given as the <b>tsv=</b> parameter.
        <br>
        The <a href="index.html">Online Itrans</a>
        page section in the middle <em>Customize the character mapping</em> will show the tsv= parameter if that file was correctly loaded.
      </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="twelve columns">
      <h4>Modifications to the spreadsheet</h4>
      <ol>
      <li>The above section outlines the steps to upload a modified spreadsheet. This section
      desribes the kinds of changes that can be done. New rows can be added (for new
      characters), new columns can be added (for new languages).
      </li>
      <li>If a new column is added, it will be automatically added to the
      <em>Default output</em>
      drop-down list. Alternately, use <code>#language your-text</code>
      to enter that text in the Enter itrans input: box. See the
      <a href="index.html#example">Examples</a> present on the online itrans page.
      The name of the column for a language name must be of the form <code>#name</code>
      And if the custom spreadsheet has language columns deleted, that will remove
      those languages from the drop-down list.
      </li>
      <li>If a new row is added, make sure the INPUT column entry does not conflict with any
      other row. Additionally, if one of the two rows starts with the same character or sequence
      of characters as the other, then the longest sequence will be matched.
      So if rows <code>k</code> and <code>h</code> and <code>kh</code> exist, then input
      text <code>kh</code> will always match the longer kh sequence row. Use <code>k_h</code>
      in the input to have it match the k row and then the h row instead.
      </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      <b>Note</b>: itrans uses a precise mapping of input codes to output code. It is not a phonetic
      conversion system, nor is it meant to be. (There are many other systems that do that.)
      Itrans is a table-driven, customizable mapping of input words to any Unicode character
      sequence.
